When you start the application, you will be greeted with a summary and a graph of all past transactions. At the top of the page there are several input boxes for the name of a transaction you want to submit and a transaction amount. The transaction amount input assumes you are using a positive value, even if you are entering a purchase.  Once you have entered the name and amount, you can press one of two buttons. The add funds button will add the transaction amount to youre current total, and the remove funds buttion will subtract it.
